        <h3>Novels</h3>
        <p>Novel, an invented prose narrative of considerable length and a certain complexity that deals imaginatively with human experience, usually through a connected sequence of events involving a group of persons in a specific setting.</p>

       <div class="block">
        <h3>Manga</h3>
        <p>To put it briefly, manga is the Japanese word for comics published in Japan. The word itself is comprised of two characters: man 漫 meaning “whimsical” and ga 画 meaning “pictures.”
            Manga can be for entertainment or education, although in the United States manga for entertainment is what is mostly translated and published. Manga is for people of all ages and it is not seen as something just for children as compared to how sometimes American comics are viewed.</p>

       <div class="block">
        <h3>Light Novels</h3>
        <p>Light novels are short, fast-paced novels that are manga-adjacent. Many use tropes familiar to avid manga readers. The slapstick comedy, the over-the-top violence, the over-exaggerated reactions — you can find all these things in light novels. The only difference is that it is prose versus a comic. As a result, many manga fans read light novels and most light novel fans read manga. The audiences overlap, and you’ll notice that North American manga publishers release light novels alongside their manga licenses regularly.</p>

      <div class="block">
        <h3>Comics</h3>
        <p>Technically, a comic is a text expressed through illustrations on strips or frames. Some or all strips can contain text of various lengths. This simple definition explains why this is considered such a versatile format: the creative use we can make of the cartoons, illustrations, words, and other elements we'll talk about later, demonstrate that the possibilities are almost endless.</p>
